Load data
```{r}
setwd("P:/Evaluation/TN Lives Count_Writing/4_Target1_EnhancedCrisisFollow-up/3_Data & Data Analyses")
target_1  = readRDS(file = "a.out_target.rds")
target_1 = target_1$imputations
target_1[[1]]


setwd("P:/Evaluation/TN Lives Count_Target2/Study 5_RELATE Enhanced Follow-up & Tech/3_Data/FINAL Relate Databases")
target_2 = readRDS("imp_mice_dat_complete.rds")
target_2[[1]]


```
Target 1 data cleaning 
Drop treatment three and ID
```{r}
test_dat = target_2[[1]] %>%


```



Take the imputed data sets from both groups (Targets)
Target 1
Subset out treatment three
Target 2 
Make demographics match 
Both
Subset out outcomes that do not match up
Then stack them and give them an indicator as to which target
Then conduct IPW 
Then conduct run between analyses with IPW as weights
